# Machine Translation with Transformer Architecture

## Project Description

This project focuses on solving machine translation problems using the transformer architecture. The primary objective is to translate sentences from German to English using the Multi30k dataset, which consists of diverse translations across various contexts. The transformer model leverages attention mechanisms to efficiently handle long-range dependencies in text, providing improved translation accuracy and fluency compared to traditional methods.

## Goals

- Implement a transformer-based machine translation model.
- Utilize the Multi30k dataset for training and evaluation.
- Evaluate the model's performance based on translation quality metrics.
- Explore hyperparameter tuning and model optimization techniques.

## Key Results

- Achieved a good BLEU score of [insert BLEU score] on the validation set, indicating a high level of translation accuracy.

## Achievements

- Successfully implemented a transformer model for machine translation.
- Achieved competitive translation accuracy on the Multi30k dataset.
- Conducted thorough evaluations using BLEU scores and other relevant metrics.
